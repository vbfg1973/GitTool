# Git Tool

Generate analyses of git repositories. 

1) Measures of complexity v number of changes, revealing risks (cognitive complexity implementation in Roslyn for VB and C#, and a more generic measure of code complexity based on line indentations)
2) Co-changing files, revealing architectural dependencies
3) Team extraction - identify team members working on similar areas of code
